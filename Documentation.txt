This folder contains a script to generate a list of keywords using google autosuggest. An app to do the same is also
present in this folder.

By entering a keyword, the script adds a letter to it and scrapes the list of google autocomplete. For example, by
entering the word "apple" the autocomplete results of "apple a" to "apple z" is scraped and returned as a csv file
